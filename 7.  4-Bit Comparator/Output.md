4-Bit Comparator

A 4-bit comparator is a combinational logic circuit that takes in two 4-bit inputs, IN-A and IN_B, and produces three output signals - OUT_A, OUT_B and OUT_C - that indicate whether IN_A is less than, greater than, or equal to IN_B respectively.

The OUT_C signal is high when IN_A and IN_B are equal, and low otherwise. The OUT_B signal is high when IN_A is greater than IN_B, and low otherwise. The OUT_A signal is high when IN_A is less than IN_B, and low otherwise.

The logic for the comparator can be implemented using a series of cascaded 1-bit comparators, which compare each bit of IN_A and IN_B one at a time. The result of each 1-bit comparison is then used to determine the value of the OUT_C, OUT_B and OUT_A signals for the overall 4-bit comparator.
